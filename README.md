### About Me!
I am a highschooler in the USA.
I dislike english and art class because it is creatively getting to a non defined answer, I like math and science because it is getting to a concrete and defined answer that you can usually tell if is correct or not, and I love coding as it is a mixture of the two; its a creative way of getting to a defined answer.

Languages:
- C++ (main)
- C# (proficient)
- Python (proficient)
- JavaScript (proficient)
- HTML (not much use)

I started off on Khan Academy ([My Account](https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/henwill/)) learning JavaScript when I was 8-11 years old and I made a couple small games I then slowed down and didn't work on many projects until I was 13-14. Next, I was introduced to modding for Beat Saber in C++ which I loved and have worked on the most. I create occasional small projects in Python though I dislike its whitespace dependency. I have used node.js to make a backend and website once on a Beat Saber multiplayer project that was hosted on Heroku. I also made a discord bot that is still running in the Beat Together discord server. I create an occasional Unity project where I use C#.

That is the end of my terribly written essay (I say that but its only two paragraphs) about my coding experience.
